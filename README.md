# React Resume Builder

This project is a **Resume Builder** built with React, showcasing advanced state management, dynamic UI rendering, and optimized performance. You can now experience it directly with the **[Live Preview](https://resumebuilder-bd4.pages.dev/)**â€”no need for any installation!

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Inputs on the left side immediately reflect in the resume preview on the right, powered by React's state management.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Organized input sections to focus on one area at a time, keeping the UI clean and manageable.
- **Auto Scrolling**: The preview automatically scrolls to the corresponding section being edited for a seamless editing experience.
- **Custom Scrollbars for Overflowing Text**: Default scrollbars are used throughout, but for certain text areas that overflow, a custom smaller scrollbar is applied, and they are resizable vertically.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient use of `React.memo` and other performance techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders and maintain speed.
